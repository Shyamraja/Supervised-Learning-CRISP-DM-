 ## About the Data Modeling.Supervised Learning
 
-What kind of model architecture best fits our data?
- How well does the model perform technically?
- Could we improve its performance?
- How do we evaluate the model's performance?

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that provides automatic, objective and data-driven techniques for modeling the data. Its two main branches are supervised learning and unsupervised learning, and in this exercise, we are going to use the former, supervised learning for classification and regression tasks.

Some data pre-processing steps are still done here to ensure that it's in an appropriate format so that models can learn from it. 

## Packages needed for this exercise:

The exercise project was done importing different useful packages and libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn  etc.


## Results

- The brief explanation of the analysis result has been described and answered in the exercises and clarified.

## How to run the project

The project can be run by cloning this repository and after that the all the used  libraries needed to be installed. After installation the project can be run and output is visible as shown in the ipynb file.
